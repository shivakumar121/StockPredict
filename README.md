This project builds a prediction algorithm to tell when to buy, sell or hold a stock. This prediction task has been set up in such a way that the algorithm will make a buy/sell/hold prediction once every day. The data which is used are the historical prices of Netflix stock dating back to 2002. A sequential neural network is built using *Keras* and *TensorFlow*. It also uses *Pandas* and *NumPy* for handling the data and doing some computations.

The [*jupyter notebook*](https://github.com/shivakumar121/StockPredict/blob/master/Ntfl_SP_NN_4.ipynb) walks through all the steps and results.
